## 🛠️ Recommended Client Mods
While Maltopia works with a vanilla client, we **highly recommend** using our modpacks to unlock the full experience (like Proximity Voice Chat).

### 📦 Download our Modpacks
We provide official files for the **Modrinth** launcher, but you can manually install these in any launcher (Prism, CurseForge, etc.).

| Pack Type | Description | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Optimal Experience** | Full feature set: Proximity Chat, Map mods, Shaders, and UI enhancements. | Mid-to-High end PCs |
| **Minimal Pack** | Essential performance fixes and Proximity Chat only. | Low-end PCs / Laptops |

> [!TIP]
> **Proximity Voice Chat:** To talk to other players in-game, you **must** have the [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) mod installed on your client!

## 📜 Server Rules
To ensure a great experience for everyone, all players must adhere to the following guidelines:

1.  **🤝 Be Kind:** Respect is the foundation of our community. Toxicity has no home here.
2.  **🛡️ Claim Your Land:** Use the **Golden Shovel** system to protect your builds. If it isn't claimed, it isn't protected!
3.  **🚫 No Griefing:** Do not destroy or alter other players' creations. We use CoreProtect to log and rollback all griefing.
4.  **⚖️ Fair Play:** No cheating, X-Raying, or hacked clients. Performance mods are allowed and encouraged.
5.  **🌈 Inclusive Environment:** Zero tolerance for racism, hate speech, or discrimination.
6.  **⚔️ PvP Conduct:** PvP is optional in the wilderness (use `/pvp off`). However, PvP is **forced ON** within the designated Arena near Spawn.
7.  **📣 Staff Authority:** Please follow instructions given by staff members.

---

## ⌨️ Quick Commands
* `/spawn` — Return to the safety of spawn.
* `/sethome` & `/home` — Save your base location.
* `/pvp [on/off]` — Toggle your combat status in the wilderness.
* `/tpa <player>` — Request to teleport to a friend.

---
### 🎤 Using Voice Chat
Maltopia uses **Simple Voice Chat** for an immersive experience. 
* **Settings Menu:** Press `V`  
* **Mute Mic:** Press `M`  
* **Push-to-Talk:** (Optional) Set this up in the `V` menu.

> [!TIP]
> If people can't hear you, press `V` -> **Settings** -> **Select Microphone** to make sure your correct device is picked!
